<p align="center"> Created a Team page. We often have seen on some courses that they have mentioned the name, photo of the developer, desginer, lead, etc. so I implemented that page  <p>
  

## Tech and Tools used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. VSCODE Editor
4. FIGMA(for Design)

## Challenge
The challenge was to build a simple Team page from HTML and CSS

## How did I do?
1. I have divided the page into three parts
      1. top div
      2. m-contaiener div(middle container)
      3. footer
2. Used flexbox for responsiveness
3. Added mediaquery for responsiveness
4. Used writing-mode. The writing-mode CSS property sets whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically,
